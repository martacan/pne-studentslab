the error is located in the line 11 since the value of t1 is 0  and the type is "ZerodivisionError" .
THis will happen anytime parameters c and d on function f are the same value
THats why results 1, 3, and 4 are properly computed.
Our argument will only fail when c and d have the same value so if we comment the line the error dissapears
